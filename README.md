## TODOs ##
BibSpace is currently undergoing serious refactoring. I try to keep current status up to date in [BibSpace Trelo Board](https://trello.com/b/yQ2VPiQ3/bibspace)

Goals of the ongoing refactoring:
- provide clean MVC without SQL in the controller
– Apply Perl Object-Oriented code design 
– Improve code orthogonality
– Remove code duplication
– Simplify templates thanks to OO
- (Future) Provide BibSpace API and separate frontend and backend



### Handbook TODO ###
- [] Describe nginx and apache2 configuration
- [] Describe cron setup
- [] Describe HTML embedding
