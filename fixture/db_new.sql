In this position paper, we discuss how the existing concept of virtual appliances can be extended to automate the extraction of architecture-level performance models during system operation.','{Towards Online Performance Model Extraction in Virtualized Environments}',0,9,2013,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:55',0),(61,'paper','bender2010','mastersthesis','@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010},\n}\n\n','\n\nKonstantin Bender.\nAutomated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics.\nMaster\'s thesis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe,\nGermany, Karlsruhe, Germany, May 2010.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-bender2010\')\">bib</a>&nbsp; ] <div id=\"bib-of-bender2010\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>\n@mastersthesis{bender2010,\naddress = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\nauthor = {Konstantin Bender},\nmonth = {May},\nschool = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\ntitle = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\nyear = {2010}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n','<a name=\"bender2010\"></a><pre>\n@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}',0,5,2010,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:55',0),(65,'paper','groenda2008c','techreport','@techreport{groenda2008c,\n  abstract = {Systematische Qualit\\\"{a}tssicherung gewinnt im Rahmen des globalenWettbewerbs auch in der Software-Entwicklungsbranche zunehmend an Bedeutung.

Es geht dabei vor allem um die Efizienzsteigerung durch die Steigerung des Standardisierungsgrades, des Automatisierungsgrades sowie eine Erh\"{o}hung der Arbeitsteilung. Dies wirkt sich einerseits auf die den Software- Systemen zu Grunde liegenden Architekturen aber auch auf die Entwicklungsprozesse aus. So sind service-orientierte Architekturen ein Beispiel f\"{u}r eine gesteigerte Standardisierung innerhalb von Software-Systemen. Es ist zu ber\"{u}cksichtigen, dass sich die Software-Branche von den klassischen produzierenden Industriezweigen dadurch unterscheidet, dass Software ein immaterielles Produkt ist und so ohne hohe Produktionskosten beliebig oft vervielf\"{a}ltigt werden kann.

These changing environments create challenges to the design of systems that can adapt themselves while maintaining desired Quality of Service (QoS), security, dependability, availability and other non-functional requirements. The next generation of resilient systems will be highly distributed, component-based and service-oriented. They will need to operate in unattended mode and possibly in hostile environments, will be composed of a large number of interchangeable components discoverable at run-time, and will have to run on a multitude of unknown and heterogeneous hardware and network platforms. These computer systems will adapt themselves to cope with changes in the operating conditions and to meet the service-level agreements with a minimum of resources. Changes in operating conditions include hardware and software failures, load variation and variations in user interaction with the system, including security attacks and overwhelming situations. This self adaptation of next resilient systems can be achieved by first online predicting how these situations would be by observation of the current environment. This chapter focuses on the use of online predicting methods, techniques and tools for resilient systems. Thus, we survey online QoS adaptive models in several environments as grid environments, service-oriented architectures and ambient intelligence using different approaches based on queueing networks, model checking, ontology engineering among others.}},\n  address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},\n  author = {Katja Gilly and Fabian Brosig and Ramon Nou and Samuel Kounev and Carlos Juiz},\n  booktitle = {Resilience Assessment and Evaluation of Computing Systems},\n  editor = {K.

In this context, elasticity is commonly understood as the ability of a system to automatically provision and de-provision computing resources on demand as workloads change. However, elasticity still lacks a precise definition as well as representative metrics coupled with a benchmarking methodology to enable comparability of systems. Existing definitions of elasticity are largely inconsistent and unspecific leading to confusion in the use of the term and its differentiation from related terms such as scalability and efficiency; the proposed measurement methodologies do not provide means to quantify elasticity without mixing it with efficiency or scalability aspects.

However, auto-scaling features introduce new system quality attributes when considering their accuracy, timing, and boundaries. Therefore, distinguishing between different offerings has become a complex task, as it is not yet supported by reliable metrics and measurement approaches. In this paper, we discuss shortcomings of existing approaches for measuring and evaluating elastic behavior and propose a novel benchmark methodology specifically designed for evaluating the elasticity aspects of modern cloud platforms. The benchmark is based on open workloads with realistic load variation profiles that are calibrated to induce identical resource demand variations independent of the underlying hardware performance.

We apply our approach to three different realistic contexts (dynamic resource allocation, software architecture optimization, and run-time adaptation planning) showing how the gap between complex manual adaptations and their autonomous execution can be closed by using a holistic model-based approach.','{S/T/A: Meta-Modeling Run-Time Adaptation in Component-Based System Architectures}',0,9,2012,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:56',0),(225,'paper','HuQuBrHaKo2012-CCaSS-ExpVirtPerfOverhead','incollection','@incollection{HuQuBrHaKo2012-CCaSS-ExpVirtPerfOverhead,\n  address = {New York},\n  author = {Huber, Nikolaus and von Quast, Marcel and Brosig, Fabian and Hauck, Michael and Kounev, Samuel},\n  booktitle = {Cloud Computing and Services Science},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-1-4614-2326-3_19},\n  editor = {Ivanov, Ivan and van Sinderen, Marten and Shishkov, Boris},\n  isbn = {978-1-4614-2325-6},\n  language = {English},\n  pages = {353--370},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/225.pdf},\n  publisher = {Springer},\n  series = {Service Science: Research and Innovations in the Service Economy},\n  title = {{A Method for Experimental Analysis and Modeling of Virtualization Performance Overhead}},\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-2326-3_19},\n  year = {2012},\n}\n\n','\n\nNikolaus Huber, Marcel von Quast, Fabian Brosig, Michael Hauck, and Samuel\nKounev.\nA Method for Experimental Analysis and Modeling of Virtualization\nPerformance Overhead.\nIn <em>Cloud Computing and Services Science</em>, Ivan Ivanov, Marten\nvan Sinderen, and Boris Shishkov, editors, Service Science: Research and\nInnovations in the Service Economy, pages 353-370.

Using two implementation variants of Sun\'s Java Pet Store application, one based strictly on the J2EE platform and the other implementing some interfaces as Web Services, performance is compared in terms of the achieved overall throughput, response times and latency.','{PetStore-WS: Measuring the Performance Implications of Web Services}',0,12,2003,12,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:56',0),(243,'paper','KaBeCaDiKuMoSt2012-EUROSYS','inproceedings','@inproceedings{KaBeCaDiKuMoSt2012-EUROSYS,\n  acmid = {2168866},\n  address = {New York, NY, USA},\n  author = {Kapitza, R\\\"{u}diger and Behl, Johannes and Cachin, Christian and Distler, Tobias and Kuhnle, Simon and Mohammadi, Seyed Vahid and Schr\\\"{o}der-Preikschat, Wolfgang and Stengel, Klaus},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 7th ACM european conference on Computer Systems},\n  doi = {10.1145/2168836.2168866},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-1223-3},\n  keywords = {byzantine failures, resource efficiency},\n  location = {Bern, Switzerland},\n  numpages = {14},\n  pages = {295--308},\n  publisher = {ACM},\n  series = {EuroSys \'12},\n  title = {CheapBFT: resource-efficient byzantine fault tolerance},\n  url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2168836.2168866},\n  year = {2012},\n}\n\n','\n\nR&uuml;diger Kapitza, Johannes Behl, Christian Cachin, Tobias Distler, Simon\nKuhnle, Seyed&nbsp;Vahid Mohammadi, Wolfgang Schr&ouml;der-Preikschat, and Klaus\nStengel.\nCheapbft: resource-efficient byzantine fault tolerance.\nIn <em>Proceedings of the 7th ACM european conference on Computer\nSystems</em>, Bern, Switzerland, 2012, EuroSys \'12, pages 295-308.

This is due to the inability to predict at run-time the effect of dynamic changes in the system environment (e.g., varying service workloads) and adapt the system configuration accordingly.

We study a real-world application, and demonstrate the benefits, in terms of modelling power and expressiveness, that QPN models provide over conventional modelling paradigms such as Queuing Networks and Petri Nets. As shown, QPNs facilitate the integration of both hardware and software aspects of system behavior in the same model. In addition to hardware contention and scheduling strategies, using QPNs one can easily model simultaneous resource possession, synchronization, blocking and contention for software resources.

The inherent complexity, heterogeneity and dynamics of Grid computing environments pose some challenges in managing their capacity to ensure that QoS requirements are continuously met. In this paper, an approach to autonomic QoS-aware resource management in Grid computing based on online performance models is proposed. The paper presents a novel methodology for designing autonomic QoS-aware resource managers that have the capability to predict the performance of the Grid components they manage and allocate resources in such a way that service level agreements are honored.

Finally, we briefly present a model-to-model transformation automatically generating a queueing Petri net model from a higher-level software architecture model annotated with performance relevant information.},\n  pdf = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/319.pdf\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/319.pdf</a>},\n  publisher = {ACM},\n  address = {New York, NY, USA},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2012), Boston, USA, 22-25 April 2012},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-1202-8},\n  doi = {10.1145/2188286.2188290},\n  author = {Kounev, Samuel and Spinner, Simon and Meier, Philipp}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{Introduction to Queueing Petri Nets: Modeling Formalism, Tool Support and Case Studies}',0,4,2012,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:57',0),(320,'paper','KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss','article','@article{KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss,\n  author = {Samuel Kounev and B{\\\"o}rn Weis and Alejandro Buchmann},\n  journal = {Journal of Computer Resource Management},\n  month = {September},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/320.pdf},\n  publisher = {Computer Measurement Group (CMG)},\n  title = {{Performance Tuning and Optimization of J2EE Applications on the JBoss Platform}},\n  volume = {113},\n  year = {2004},\n}\n\n','\n\nSamuel Kounev, B&ouml;rn Weis, and Alejandro Buchmann.\nPerformance Tuning and Optimization of J2EE Applications on the\nJBoss Platform.\n<em>Journal of Computer Resource Management</em>, 113, September 2004,\nComputer Measurement Group (CMG).\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/320.pdf\" target=\"blank\">.pdf</a>&nbsp; ] <div id=\"bib-of-KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>\n@article{KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss,\nauthor = {Samuel Kounev and B{\\\"o}rn Weis and Alejandro Buchmann},\njournal = {Journal of Computer Resource Management},\nmonth = {September},\npdf = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/320.pdf\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/320.pdf</a>},\npublisher = {Computer Measurement Group (CMG)},\ntitle = {{Performance Tuning and Optimization of J2EE Applications on the JBoss Platform}},\nvolume = {113},\nyear = {2004}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n','<a name=\"KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss\"></a><pre>\n@article{KoWeBu2004-CMG_JCRM-JBoss,\n  author = {Samuel Kounev and B{\\\"o}rn Weis and Alejandro Buchmann},\n  journal = {Journal of Computer Resource Management},\n  month = {September},\n  pdf = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/320.pdf\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/320.pdf</a>},\n  publisher = {Computer Measurement Group (CMG)},\n  title = {{Performance Tuning and Optimization of J2EE Applications on the JBoss Platform}},\n  volume = {113},\n  year = {2004}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{Performance Tuning and Optimization of J2EE Applications on the JBoss Platform}',0,9,2004,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:57',0),(329,'paper','KoNoRe2011-MODELS-Invited','inproceedings','@inproceedings{KoNoRe2011-MODELS-Invited,\n  abstract = {Quantitative prediction of non-functional properties, such as performance, reliability, and costs, of software architectures supports systematic software engineering.

Such IDSes can monitor at the same time the network and host activities of all guest VMs running on top of a VMM being isolated from malicious users of these VMs. We refer to IDSes for virtualized environments as VMM-based IDSes. In this work, we analyze state-of-the-art intrusion detection techniques applied in virtualized environments and architectures of VMM-based IDSes. Further, we identify challenges that apply specifically to benchmarking VMM-based IDSes focussing on workloads and metrics.

One way to achieve this is by using online performance models that get generated and analyzed on the fly. In this paper, we present a novel case study with the Globus Toolkit in which we show how performance models can be generated dynamically and used to provide online performance prediction capabilities. We have augmented the Grid middleware with an online performance prediction component that can be called at any time during operation to predict the Grid performance for a given resource allocation and load-balancing strategy. We evaluate the quality of our performance prediction mechanism and present some experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality. The framework we propose can be used to design intelligent QoS-aware resource allocation and admission control mechanisms.','{Building Online Performance Models of Grid Middleware with Fine-Grained Load-Balancing: A Globus Toolkit Case Study}',0,9,2007,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:58',0),(481,'paper','PiEyKoSh2007-DEBS-PubSubAPI','inproceedings','@inproceedings{PiEyKoSh2007-DEBS-PubSubAPI,\n  abstract = {Over the last decade a wide range of publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems have come out of the research community.

Over the past decade, the efficient sharing of computational resources through virtualization has been subject to intensive research, while network management in cloud data centers has received less attention. A variety of network-intensive applications require QoS (Quality-of-Service) provisioning, performance isolation and support for flexible and efficient migration of virtual machines. In this paper, we survey existing network virtualization approaches and evaluate the extent to which they can be used as a basis for realizing the mentioned requirements in a cloud data center. More specifically, we identify generic network virtualization techniques, characterize them according to their features related to QoS management and performance isolation, and show how they can be composed together and used as building blocks for complex network virtualization solutions. We then present an overview of selected representative cloud platforms and show how they leverage the generic techniques as a basis for network resource management.

Aim of this paper is to focus on the very last phase of the composition process, where proper atomic service versions are picked to execute the whole complex service. An exact algorithm is proposed in this paper solving two tasks based on popular quality of service delivery approaches: best-effort and differentiated services. The procedure of graph reduction has been introduced to generate space of possible solutions in such way that decision is made in more efficient way. The graph-fold algorithm was tested in simulation environment where its performance was compared to five reference algorithms. Moreover ability to deliver quality at desired level has been tested.','{Optimal Complex Services Composition in SOA Systems}',0,9,2010,9,NULL,NULL,'SOA','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:41:00',0),(665,'paper','RyPs2010-ICSS-handover','incollection','@incollection{RyPs2010-ICSS-handover,\n  address = {ul.

It is assumed that in certain area covered by multiple overlapping wireless networks there is certain number of mobile client which consume networks resources by use of available communication services (e.g., voice or data transmission) delivered by network providers. Moreover it is assumed, that communication services continuity may be assured with use of common handover techniques supporting clients mobility (e.g: MIPv6, IEEE 802.21, etc.). The task of mobility and resources management consists of making decisions concerning the moment and the network to which particular clients should be handed over in order to optimize certain quality criterion (e.g. utilization of network resources). In this paper we show that gathering knowledge about clients movement and prediction of their future position may significantly improve the overall quality of delivered services and network resources utilization.','{Prediction Based Handovers for Wireless Networks Resources Management}',0,9,2011,9,NULL,NULL,'QoS in Networks; Resource Management; Prediction; Networking;','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:41:01',0),(673,'paper','RyTo2011-KES','inproceedings','@inproceedings{RyTo2011-KES,\n  address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},\n  author = {Rygielski, Piotr and Tomczak, Jakub},\n  booktitle = {Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, Part II (KES 2011)},\n  day = {12--14},\n  edition = {1},\n  editor = {Koenig, A. and Dengel, A. and Hinkelmann, K. and Kise, K. and Howlett, R.J. and Jain, L.C.},\n  isbn = {978-3-642-23862-8},\n  location = {Kaiserslautern, Germany},\n  month = {September},\n  pages = {591--600},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/673.pdf},\n  publisher = {Springer-Verlag},\n  series = {{Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)}},\n  title = {{Context Change Detection for Resource Allocation in Service-Oriented Systems}},\n  volume = {6882},\n  year = {2011},\n  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of detecting the major changes in the stream of service requests is formulated.

Nowadays, modern processors enable performance improvements by increasing the number of cores. However, existing software needs to be adapted to be able to utilize multiple cores. Such an adaptation poses many challenges in the field of discrete-event software simulation. Decades of intensive research have been spent to find a general solution for parallel discrete event simulation. In this context, QNs and PNs have been extensively studied. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one previous work that considers the concurrent simulation of QPN [Juergens1997]. This work focuses on comparing different synchronization algorithms and excludes a majority of lookahead calculation and net decomposition. In this thesis, we build upon and extend this work.

We show that despite the high level of abstraction of the QPNs, we are able to estimate the utilization of resources with good accuracy within a short time.','{Data Center Network Throughput Analysis using Queueing Petri Nets}',0,6,2014,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:41:01',0),(706,'paper','KrScHe2014-HotTopiCS-OptimizationApproach','inproceedings','@inproceedings{KrScHe2014-HotTopiCS-OptimizationApproach,\n  abstract = {{Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) often shares one single application instance among different tenants to reduce costs.

With their growing popularity and gradual adoption in mission critical areas, the need for novel techniques for benchmarking and performance modeling of event-based systems is increasing.

An exact dot product is one of the features of the upcoming interval standard (IEEE Interval Standard Working Group, P1788. http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1788/). Usually an accumulator is realized as a memory block with operations to add floating point numbers and products. Several variants have been proposed to avoid carry rippling: use separate accumulators for positive and negative numbers, initialize the accu with a pattern not equal to zero, or perform a kind of carry look-ahead-technique. All these approaches are described in detail in Kulisch (Computer arithmetic and validityÂ—theory, implementation, and applications. Series: de Gruyter Studies in Mathematics 33, 2008) and Bohlender (Computer arithmetic and self-validating numerical methods, Academic Press, San Diego, 1990). In this paper we propose a long accumulator similar to a carry-save adder. The main idea is to augment the long accumulator with cache information. The cache is used to store the carries or borrows, instead of propagating them through the whole accumulator every time. Due to the cache, operations are kept local in our approach. The full information of the exact result is represented by the accu and the cache. When we want to deliver the result we have to add the contents of the cache into the accumulator. In this paper we present an implementation in software and compare it with other approaches. Furthermore we discuss the advantages of this algorithm for a hardware implementation.','A long accumulator like a carry-save adder',0,0,2012,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:41:02',0),(740,'paper','iaHardwareScan2010','article','@article{iaHardwareScan2010,\n  abstract = {Interval arithmetic, as it is standardized by the IEEE working group P1788 can be implemented by using floating point arithmetic units with directed rounding modes.

Conventional benchmarking frameworks provide limited support for emulating such highly variable and dynamic load profiles and workload scenarios. Industrial benchmarks typically use workloads with constant or stepwise increasing load intensity, or they simply replay recorded workload traces. Based on this observation, I identify the need for means allowing flexible definition of load profiles and address this by introducing two meta-models at different abstraction levels. At the lower abstraction level, the Descartes Load Intensity Meta-Model (DLIM) offers a structured and accessible way of describing the load intensity over time by editing and combining mathematical functions. The high-level Descartes Load Intensity Meta-Model (hl-DLIM) allows the description of load variations using few defined parameters that characterize the seasonal patterns, trends, bursts, and noise parts. Using these parameters, hl-DLIM is capable of describing a subset of most common load intensity variations. During the work on this thesis I developed LIMBO - an Eclipse-based tool for modeling variable load intensity profiles based on DLIM and hl-DLIM as underlying modeling formalisms. LIMBO provides visualization for DLIM instances and a model creation wizard based on hl-DLIM parameters. It also offers three automated model extraction processes with which to extract DLIM and hl-DLIM instances from existing arrival rate traces. It also offers a model-to-model transformation from hl-DLIM to DLIM.

Due to the tight coupling and sharing of resources on all layers up to the application layer, customers may influence each other with regards to the performance they observe. Existing research on performance isolation of MTAs focuses on methods and concrete algorithms.

Arnold and Samuel Kounev},\n  abstract = {{Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant issue over the last years. Load distribution plays a crucial role in the improvement of energy efficiency as (un-)balancing strategies can be leveraged to distribute load over one or multiple systems in a way in which resources are utilized at high performance, yet low overall power consumption. This can be achieved on multiple levels, from load distribution on single CPU cores to machine level load balancing on distributed systems. With modern day server architectures providing load balancing opportunities at several layers, answering the question of optimal load distribution has become non-trivial. Work has to be distributed hierarchically in a fashion that enables maximum energy efficiency at each level. Current approaches balance load based on generalized assumptions about the energy efficiency of servers. These assumptions are based either on very machine-specific or highly generalized observations that may or may not hold true over a variety of systems and configurations. In this paper, we use a modified version of the SPEC SERT suite to measure the energy efficiency of a variety of hierarchical load distribution strategies on single and multi-node systems.

The classification scheme and the experimental comparison helps performance engineers to select an approach to resource demand estimation that fulfills the requirements of a given analysis scenario.','{Evaluating Approaches to Resource Demand Estimation}',0,10,2015,10,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-07-17 17:42:05','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(891,'paper','HuWaBaKo2015-ICCAC-BlueYonder','inproceedings','@inproceedings{HuWaBaKo2015-ICCAC-BlueYonder,\n  author = {Nikolaus Huber and J\\\"{u}rgen Walter and Manuel B\\\"{a}hr and Samuel Kounev},\n  title = {{Model-based Autonomic and Performance-aware System Adaptation in Heterogeneous Resource Environments: A Case Study}},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {September},\n  day = {21-24},\n  publisher = {IEEE},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC)},\n  location = {Cambridge, MA, USA},\n  abstract = {Recent trends like cloud computing show that service providers increasingly adopt to modern self-adaptive system architectures promising higher resource efficiency and lower operating costs.

This work enables for the first time the injection of attacks in virtualized environments for the purpose of generating representative IDS evaluation workloads.}','{Evaluation of Intrusion Detection Systems in Virtualized Environments Using Attack Injection}',0,11,2015,11,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-08-15 11:09:29','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(894,'paper','Krebs2015-phd','phdthesis','@phdthesis{Krebs2015-phd,\n  author = {Rouven Krebs},\n  title = {Performance Isolation in Multi-Tenant Applications},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {August},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/894.pdf},\n}\n\n','\n\nRouven Krebs.\n<em>Performance Isolation in Multi-Tenant Applications</em>.\nPhD thesis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe,\nGermany, August 2015.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-Krebs2015-phd\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/894.pdf\" target=\"blank\">.pdf</a>&nbsp;

The results of this paper show that selection of a processor sample can have a statistically significant impact on power consumption. With no correlation to performance, power consumption for nominally identical processors can differ as much as 29.6\\% in idle and 19.5\\% at full load. We also show that these variations change over different architectures and processor types.}','{Variations in CPU Power Consumption}',0,3,2016,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-11-17 12:09:54','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(912,'talk','talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14','misc','@misc{talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14,\n  author = {Simon Spinner},\n  title = {{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}},\n  howpublished = {Technical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group},\n  days = {25},\n  month = {July},\n  year = {2014},\n  slides = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912},\n}\n\n','\n\nSimon Spinner.\nLibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation.\nTechnical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group, July 2014.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912\" target=\"blank\">slides</a>&nbsp; ] <div id=\"bib-of-talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>\n@misc{talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14,\nauthor = {Simon Spinner},\ntitle = {{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}},\nhowpublished = {Technical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group},\ndays = {25},\nmonth = {July},\nyear = {2014},\nslides = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912</a>}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n','<a name=\"talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14\"></a><pre>\n@misc{talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14,\n  author = {Simon Spinner},\n  title = {{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}},\n  howpublished = {Technical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group},\n  days = {25},\n  month = {July},\n  year = {2014},\n  slides = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912</a>}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}',0,7,2014,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-11-26 09:48:52','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(913,'paper','RySiSiAschKoSch2016-dni-traffic-extraction-icpe2016','inproceedings','@inproceedings{RySiSiAschKoSch2016-dni-traffic-extraction-icpe2016,\n  author = {Piotr Rygielski and Viliam Simko and Felix Sittner and Doris Aschenbrenner and Samuel Kounev and Klaus Schilling},\n  title = {{Automated Extraction of Network Traffic Models Suitable for Performance Simulation}},\n  year = {2016},\n  month = {March},\n  day = {12--18},\n  pages = {27--35},\n  doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2851553.2851570},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 7th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2016)},\n  location = {Delft, The Netherlands},\n  publisher = {ACM},\n  abstract = {{Data centers are increasingly becoming larger and dynamic due to virtualization.

Towards realizing the DPE vision, we discuss the different requirements and propose a reference architecture for implementing and integrating respective methods, algorithms, and tooling.','{Asking ``What?\'\', Automating the ``How?\'\': The Vision of Declarative Performance Engineering}',0,3,2016,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-01-11 15:32:13','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(916,'paper','PMX2015','article','@article{PMX2015,\n  author = {einBLICK (Robert Emmerich)},\n  title = {{Leistung von IT-Systemen vorhersagen}},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {December},\n  day = {23},\n  pages = {1-2},\n  url = {http://www.presse.uni-wuerzburg.de/einblick/single_special/artikel/leistung-von-it-systemen-vorhersagen/},\n  comment = {Samuel Kounev and J\\\"{u}rgen Walter},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/916.pdf},\n}\n\n','\n\neinBLICK (Robert&nbsp;Emmerich).\nLeistung von IT-Systemen vorhersagen.\npages 1-2, December 2015.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-PMX2015\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://www.presse.uni-wuerzburg.de/einblick/single_special/artikel/leistung-von-it-systemen-vorhersagen/\" target=\"blank\">http</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/916.pdf\" target=\"blank\">.pdf</a>&nbsp;
