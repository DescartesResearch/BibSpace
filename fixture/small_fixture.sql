In this position paper, we discuss how the existing concept of virtual appliances can be extended to automate the extraction of architecture-level performance models during system operation.','{Towards Online Performance Model Extraction in Virtualized Environments}',0,9,2013,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:55',0),(61,'paper','bender2010','mastersthesis','@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010},\n}\n\n','\n\nKonstantin Bender.\nAutomated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics.\nMaster\'s thesis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe,\nGermany, Karlsruhe, Germany, May 2010.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-bender2010\')\">bib</a>&nbsp; ] <div id=\"bib-of-bender2010\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>\n@mastersthesis{bender2010,\naddress = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\nauthor = {Konstantin Bender},\nmonth = {May},\nschool = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\ntitle = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\nyear = {2010}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n','<a name=\"bender2010\"></a><pre>\n@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}',0,5,2010,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:55',0),(65,'paper','groenda2008c','techreport','@techreport{groenda2008c,\n  abstract = {Systematische Qualit\\\"{a}tssicherung gewinnt im Rahmen des globalenWettbewerbs auch in der Software-Entwicklungsbranche zunehmend an Bedeutung.

Es geht dabei vor allem um die Efizienzsteigerung durch die Steigerung des Standardisierungsgrades, des Automatisierungsgrades sowie eine Erh\"{o}hung der Arbeitsteilung. Dies wirkt sich einerseits auf die den Software- Systemen zu Grunde liegenden Architekturen aber auch auf die Entwicklungsprozesse aus. So sind service-orientierte Architekturen ein Beispiel f\"{u}r eine gesteigerte Standardisierung innerhalb von Software-Systemen. Es ist zu ber\"{u}cksichtigen, dass sich die Software-Branche von den klassischen produzierenden Industriezweigen dadurch unterscheidet, dass Software ein immaterielles Produkt ist und so ohne hohe Produktionskosten beliebig oft vervielf\"{a}ltigt werden kann.

These changing environments create challenges to the design of systems that can adapt themselves while maintaining desired Quality of Service (QoS), security, dependability, availability and other non-functional requirements. The next generation of resilient systems will be highly distributed, component-based and service-oriented. They will need to operate in unattended mode and possibly in hostile environments, will be composed of a large number of interchangeable components discoverable at run-time, and will have to run on a multitude of unknown and heterogeneous hardware and network platforms. These computer systems will adapt themselves to cope with changes in the operating conditions and to meet the service-level agreements with a minimum of resources. Changes in operating conditions include hardware and software failures, load variation and variations in user interaction with the system, including security attacks and overwhelming situations. This self adaptation of next resilient systems can be achieved by first online predicting how these situations would be by observation of the current environment. This chapter focuses on the use of online predicting methods, techniques and tools for resilient systems. Thus, we survey online QoS adaptive models in several environments as grid environments, service-oriented architectures and ambient intelligence using different approaches based on queueing networks, model checking, ontology engineering among others.}},\n  address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},\n  author = {Katja Gilly and Fabian Brosig and Ramon Nou and Samuel Kounev and Carlos Juiz},\n  booktitle = {Resilience Assessment and Evaluation of Computing Systems},\n  editor = {K.

In this context, elasticity is commonly understood as the ability of a system to automatically provision and de-provision computing resources on demand as workloads change. However, elasticity still lacks a precise definition as well as representative metrics coupled with a benchmarking methodology to enable comparability of systems. Existing definitions of elasticity are largely inconsistent and unspecific leading to confusion in the use of the term and its differentiation from related terms such as scalability and efficiency; the proposed measurement methodologies do not provide means to quantify elasticity without mixing it with efficiency or scalability aspects.

However, auto-scaling features introduce new system quality attributes when considering their accuracy, timing, and boundaries. Therefore, distinguishing between different offerings has become a complex task, as it is not yet supported by reliable metrics and measurement approaches. In this paper, we discuss shortcomings of existing approaches for measuring and evaluating elastic behavior and propose a novel benchmark methodology specifically designed for evaluating the elasticity aspects of modern cloud platforms. The benchmark is based on open workloads with realistic load variation profiles that are calibrated to induce identical resource demand variations independent of the underlying hardware performance.

We apply our approach to three different realistic contexts (dynamic resource allocation, software architecture optimization, and run-time adaptation planning) showing how the gap between complex manual adaptations and their autonomous execution can be closed by using a holistic model-based approach.','{S/T/A: Meta-Modeling Run-Time Adaptation in Component-Based System Architectures}',0,9,2012,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:56',0),(225,'paper','HuQuBrHaKo2012-CCaSS-ExpVirtPerfOverhead','incollection','@incollection{HuQuBrHaKo2012-CCaSS-ExpVirtPerfOverhead,\n  address = {New York},\n  author = {Huber, Nikolaus and von Quast, Marcel and Brosig, Fabian and Hauck, Michael and Kounev, Samuel},\n  booktitle = {Cloud Computing and Services Science},\n  doi = {10.1007/978-1-4614-2326-3_19},\n  editor = {Ivanov, Ivan and van Sinderen, Marten and Shishkov, Boris},\n  isbn = {978-1-4614-2325-6},\n  language = {English},\n  pages = {353--370},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/225.pdf},\n  publisher = {Springer},\n  series = {Service Science: Research and Innovations in the Service Economy},\n  title = {{A Method for Experimental Analysis and Modeling of Virtualization Performance Overhead}},\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-2326-3_19},\n  year = {2012},\n}\n\n','\n\nNikolaus Huber, Marcel von Quast, Fabian Brosig, Michael Hauck, and Samuel\nKounev.\nA Method for Experimental Analysis and Modeling of Virtualization\nPerformance Overhead.\nIn <em>Cloud Computing and Services Science</em>, Ivan Ivanov, Marten\nvan Sinderen, and Boris Shishkov, editors, Service Science: Research and\nInnovations in the Service Economy, pages 353-370.

Service composition frameworks offer corresponding functionality and hide the complexity of the underlying technologies from their users. However, possibilities for anticipating quality properties of com- posed services before their actual operation are limited so far. While existing approaches for model-based software quality prediction can be used by service composers for determining realizable Quality of Service (QoS) levels, integration of such techniques into composition frameworks is still missing. As a result, high effort and expert knowledge is required to build the system models required for prediction. In this paper, we present a novel service composition process that includes QoS prediction for composed services as an integral part.

Finally, we wrap up with an outlook on the emergence of self-aware systems engineering as a new research area at the intersection of several computer science disciplines.}','Model-based Techniques for Performance Engineering of Business Information Systems',0,0,2012,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:57',0),(311,'paper','KoRaKl2012-FESCA-Keynote','article','@article{KoRaKl2012-FESCA-Keynote,\n  abstract = {Event-based communication is used in different domains including telecommunications, transportation, and business information systems to build scalable distributed systems.

Even though there usually is a rough idea on bounds for quality of service, the exact required values may be unclear and subject to trade-offs. Designing architectures that exhibit such good trade-off between multiple quality attributes is hard. Even with a given functional design, many degrees of freedom in the software architecture (e.g. component deployment or server configuration) span a large design space. Automated approaches search the design space with multi-objective metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms. However, as quality prediction for a single architecture is computationally expensive, these approaches are time consuming. In this work, we enhance an automated improvement approach to take into account bounds for quality of service in order to focus the search on interesting regions of the objective space, while still allowing trade-offs after the search. We compare two different constraint handling techniques to consider the bounds. To validate our approach, we applied both techniques to an architecture model of a component-based business information system. We compared both techniques to an unbounded search in 4 scenarios. Every scenario was examined with 10 optimization runs, each investigating around 1600 architectural candidates. The results indicate that the integration of quality of service bounds during the optimization process can improve the quality of the solutions found, however, the effect depends on the scenario, i.e. the problem and the quality requirements. The best results were achieved for costs requirements: The approach was able to decrease the time needed to find good solutions in the interesting regions of the objective space by 25\\% on average.','Focussing Multi-objective Software Architecture Optimization Using Quality of Service Bounds',0,0,2011,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:57',0),(367,'paper','Kr2010-uspatent-adaptive-elearning','misc','@misc{Kr2010-uspatent-adaptive-elearning,\n  author = {Krebs, Rouven},\n  howpublished = {Patent US8108327},\n  month = {March},\n  title = {METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FOR AN ADAPTIVE LEARNING STRATEGY},\n  year = {2010},\n}\n\n','\n\nRouven Krebs.\nMethod and system for for an adaptive learning strategy.\nPatent US8108327, March 2010.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-Kr2010-uspatent-adaptive-elearning\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;

We also present preliminary work on measuring elasticity of resource pools provided by the Java Virtual Machine.}','{Defining and Quantifying Elasticity of Resources in Cloud Computing and Scalable Platforms}',0,0,2011,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:58',0),(405,'paper','LoKr2013-Closer-Isolation','inproceedings','@inproceedings{LoKr2013-Closer-Isolation,\n  author = {Loesch, Manuel and Krebs, Rouven},\n  booktitle = {{Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Service Science (CLOSER 2013)}},\n  day = {8--10},\n  location = {Aachen, Germany},\n  month = {May},\n  organization = {RWTH Aachen, Germany},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/405.pdf},\n  publisher = {SciTePress},\n  title = {{Conceptual Approach for Performance Isolation in Multi-Tenant Systems}},\n  titleaddon = {Short Paper},\n  year = {2013},\n}\n\n','\n\nManuel Loesch and Rouven Krebs.\nConceptual Approach for Performance Isolation in Multi-Tenant\nSystems short paper.\nIn <em>Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Cloud\nComputing and Service Science (CLOSER 2013)</em>, Aachen, Germany, May 8-10,\n2013.

However, the loose coupling of components in such systems makes it hard for developers to estimate their behaviour and performance under load. Most general purpose performance meta-models for component-based systems provide limited support for modelling event-driven communication. In this paper, we present a case study of a real-life road traffic monitoring system that shows how event-driven communication can be modelled for performance prediction and capacity planning. Our approach is based on the Palladio Component Model (PCM) which we have extended to support event-driven communication.

However, the loose coupling of components in such systems makes it hard for developers to predict their performance under load. Most general purpose performance meta-models for component-based systems provide limited support for modelling event-based communication and neglect middleware-specific influence factors.

Finally, we outline open issues and research challenges in the area of performance modeling and proactive resource management of virtualized data center infrastructures.','{Network Virtualization for QoS-Aware Resource Management in Cloud Data Centers: A Survey}',0,2,2013,2,NULL,NULL,'Networking; QoS in Networks; Virtualization; Cloud; Survey','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:40:59',0),(560,'paper','RyZsKo2013-DNI-meta-model','inproceedings','@inproceedings{RyZsKo2013-DNI-meta-model,\n  address = {New York, NY, USA},\n  author = {Piotr Rygielski and Steffen Zschaler and Samuel Kounev},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 4th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2013)},\n  day = {21--24},\n  location = {Prague, Czech Republic},\n  month = {April},\n  pages = {327--330},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/560.pdf},\n  publisher = {ACM},\n  title = {{A Meta-Model for Performance Modeling of Dynamic Virtualized Network Infrastructures}},\n  titleaddon = {{(work-in-progress paper)}},\n  url = {http://icpe2013.ipd.kit.edu/},\n  year = {2013},\n  abstract = {In this work-in-progress paper, we present a new meta-model designed for the performance modeling of dynamic data center network infrastructures.

The considered complex service composition process consists of three stages: complex service structure, scenario and plan composition. Complex service structure contains a set of required functionalities and precedence relations between them, and is derived directly from a service level agreement. Service scenario is derived from service structure by choosing the optimal (in the sense of certain quality criterion) order of execution of required functionalities. Finally, a service plan emerges from a scenario by choosing the best versions of atomic services for the delivery of required functionalities. For such distinguished composition process methods for complex service scenario and execution plan optimization are proposed.

To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage (e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control. The resource demand estimation is used to determine resource consumption information for individual requests. The admission control mechanism uses this knowledge to delay requests originating from tenants that exceed their allocated resource share. The proposed method is validated by a widely accepted benchmark showing its applicability in a setup motivated by today\'s platform environments.}},\n  author = {Rouven Krebs and Simon Spinner and Nadia Ahmed and Samuel Kounev},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid 2014)},\n  day = {26},\n  location = {Chicago, IL, USA},\n  month = {May},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/707.pdf},\n  publisher = {IEEE/ACM},\n  title = {{Resource Usage Control In Multi-Tenant Applications}},\n  note = {Acceptance Rate: 19\\% (54/283)},\n  year = {2014},\n  doi = {10.1109/CCGrid.2014.80},\n  pages = {122-131},\n}\n\n','\n\nRouven Krebs, Simon Spinner, Nadia Ahmed, and Samuel Kounev.\nResource Usage Control In Multi-Tenant Applications.\nIn <em>Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on\nCluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid 2014)</em>, Chicago, IL, USA, May 26,\n2014, pages 122-131.

Aiming at the general power function for inclusion in interval libraries, which is defined for as many pairs of base and exponent as possible, we observe that the definition of a power for each such pair depends on the context. This problem eventually comes up at the point where reasonable doubts about the definition 0_sup_0 and powers with negative base in correlation with a non-integral exponent arise.

In order to fulfill these SLOs, it is necessary to allocate sufficient resources of different types (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) to an application. However, the relationship between the application performance and the resource allocations is complex and depends on multiple factors including application architecture, system configuration, and workload demands. In this paper, we present a model-based approach to ensure that the application performance meets the user-defined SLO efficiently by runtime \"vertical scaling\" (i.e., adding or removing resources) of individual virtual machines (VMs) running the application. A layered performance model describing the relationship between the resource allocations and the observed application performance is automatically extracted and updated online using resource demand estimation techniques. Such a model is then used in a feedback controller to dynamically adapt the number of virtual CPUs of individual VMs. We have implemented the controller on top of the VMware vSphere platform and evaluated it in a case study using a real-world email and groupware server. The experimental results show that our approach allows the managed application to achieve SLO satisfaction in spite of workload demand variation while avoiding oscillations commonly observed with state-of-the-art threshold-based controllers.},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/746.pdf},\n  slides = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/746},\n}\n\n','\n\nSimon Spinner, Samuel Kounev, Xiaoyun Zhu, Lei Lu, Mustafa Uysal, Anne Holler,\nand Rean Griffith.\nRuntime Vertical Scaling of Virtualized Applications via Online\nModel Estimation.\nIn <em>Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Eighth International Conference\non Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO)</em>, London, UK, September\n8-12, 2014, pages 157-166.

As a result, attackers are exploring vectors to attack hypervisors, against which an attack may be executed via several attack vectors such as device drivers, virtual machine exit events, or hypercalls. Hypercalls enable intrusions in hypervisors through their hypercall interfaces. Despite the importance, there is very limited publicly available information on vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers and attacks triggering them, which significantly hinders advances towards monitoring and securing these interfaces. In this paper, we characterize the hypercall attack surface based on analyzing a set of vulnerabilities of hypercall handlers. We systematize and discuss the errors that caused the considered vulnerabilities, and activities for executing attacks triggering them.

Hence, a number of experiments on different net characteristics were conducted showing that for certain models a superlinear speedup is possible.','{Parallel Simulation of Queueing Petri Nets}',0,8,2015,8,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2016-06-01 09:41:04',0),(793,'paper','CaAnViMiKo2015-DSN-Challenges','inproceedings','@inproceedings{CaAnViMiKo2015-DSN-Challenges,\n  author = {Diogo Carvalho and Nuno Antunes and Marco Vieira and Aleksandar Milenkoski and Samuel Kounev},\n  booktitle = {The 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2015)},\n  publisher = {{IEEE}},\n  location = {Rio de Janeiro, Brazil},\n  title = {{Challenges of Assessing the Hypercall Interface Robustness}},\n  titleaddon = {{(Fast Abstract)}},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {June},\n  abstract = {{Assessing the robustness of hypercall interfaces is essential to understand the dependability of virtualized infrastructures.

Due to its low computation time and acceptable margin of error, this heuristic can be employed by automatic decision systems operating in dynamic environments.}','{Specialized Heuristics for the Controller Placement Problem in Large Scale SDN Networks}',0,9,2015,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-18 08:02:38','2016-06-01 09:41:04',0),(804,'talk','talk-Kounev-WsWue15','misc','@misc{talk-Kounev-WsWue15,\n  author = {Samuel Kounev},\n  title = {{Engineering & Provisioning of Cloud Applications - Research and Entrepreneurship}},\n  howpublished = {Winder School, University of W\\\"urzburg, Germany},\n  days = {17},\n  month = {February},\n  year = {2015},\n  slides = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/804},\n}\n\n','\n\nSamuel Kounev.\nEngineering & Provisioning of Cloud Applications - Research and\nEntrepreneurship.\nWinder School, University of W&uuml;rzburg, Germany, February 2015.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-talk-Kounev-WsWue15\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/804\" target=\"blank\">slides</a>&nbsp;

Load distribution plays a crucial role in the improvement of energy efficiency as (un-)balancing strategies can be leveraged to distribute load over one or multiple systems in a way in which resources are utilized at high performance, yet low overall power consumption.

As modeling formalism, we employ the Descartes Modeling Language (DML), a domain-specific language for modeling the performance behavior and run-time adaptation processes of modern dynamic IT systems. This case study is an exemplar for applying a holistic model-based approach to engineering performance-aware system adaptation. More specifically, the results evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate that DML provides suitable modeling abstractions that can be used as a basis for self-adaptive performance and resource management.','{Model-based Autonomic and Performance-aware System Adaptation in Heterogeneous Resource Environments: A Case Study}',0,9,2015,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-07-22 12:27:08','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(892,'paper','SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda','techreport','@techreport{SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda,\n  title = {Performance-oriented {DevOps}: {A} Research Agenda},\n  author = {Andreas Brunnert and Andre van Hoorn and Felix Willnecker and Alexandru Danciu and Wilhelm Hasselbring and Christoph Heger and Nikolas Herbst and Pooyan Jamshidi and Reiner Jung and Joakim von Kistowski and Anne Koziolek and Johannes Kro{\\ss} and Simon Spinner and Christian V{\\\"o}gele and J{\\\"u}rgen Walter and Alexander Wert},\n  institution = {SPEC Research Group --- DevOps Performance Working Group, Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC)},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {August},\n  number = {SPEC-RG-2015-01},\n  url = {https://research.spec.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/wg_devops/endorsed_publications/SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda.pdf},\n  abstract = {DevOps is a trend towards a tighter integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.

A common approach to address this problem is the creation of power or performance state tables for a pre-measured subset of all possible system states. Approaches to determine performance and power for a state not included in the measured subset use simple interpolation, such as nearest neighbor interpolation, or define state switching rules. This leads to a loss in accuracy, as unmeasured system states are not considered.

We also show that these variations change over different architectures and processor types.}','{Variations in CPU Power Consumption}',0,3,2016,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-11-17 12:09:54','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(912,'talk','talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14','misc','@misc{talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14,\n  author = {Simon Spinner},\n  title = {{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}},\n  howpublished = {Technical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group},\n  days = {25},\n  month = {July},\n  year = {2014},\n  slides = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912},\n}\n\n','\n\nSimon Spinner.\nLibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation.\nTechnical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group, July 2014.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912\" target=\"blank\">slides</a>&nbsp; ] <div id=\"bib-of-talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>\n@misc{talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14,\nauthor = {Simon Spinner},\ntitle = {{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}},\nhowpublished = {Technical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group},\ndays = {25},\nmonth = {July},\nyear = {2014},\nslides = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912</a>}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n','<a name=\"talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14\"></a><pre>\n@misc{talk-Spinner-SPECdevops14,\n  author = {Simon Spinner},\n  title = {{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}},\n  howpublished = {Technical Talk at SPEC DevOps Performance Working Group},\n  days = {25},\n  month = {July},\n  year = {2014},\n  slides = {<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912\">http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/slides/912</a>}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{LibReDE - A library for Resource Demand Estimation}',0,7,2014,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-11-26 09:48:52','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(913,'paper','RySiSiAschKoSch2016-dni-traffic-extraction-icpe2016','inproceedings','@inproceedings{RySiSiAschKoSch2016-dni-traffic-extraction-icpe2016,\n  author = {Piotr Rygielski and Viliam Simko and Felix Sittner and Doris Aschenbrenner and Samuel Kounev and Klaus Schilling},\n  title = {{Automated Extraction of Network Traffic Models Suitable for Performance Simulation}},\n  year = {2016},\n  month = {March},\n  day = {12--18},\n  pages = {27--35},\n  doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2851553.2851570},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 7th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2016)},\n  location = {Delft, The Netherlands},\n  publisher = {ACM},\n  abstract = {{Data centers are increasingly becoming larger and dynamic due to virtualization.

Towards realizing the DPE vision, we discuss the different requirements and propose a reference architecture for implementing and integrating respective methods, algorithms, and tooling.','{Asking ``What?\'\', Automating the ``How?\'\': The Vision of Declarative Performance Engineering}',0,3,2016,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-01-11 15:32:13','2016-06-01 09:41:06',0),(916,'paper','PMX2015','article','@article{PMX2015,\n  author = {einBLICK (Robert Emmerich)},\n  title = {{Leistung von IT-Systemen vorhersagen}},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {December},\n  day = {23},\n  pages = {1-2},\n  url = {http://www.presse.uni-wuerzburg.de/einblick/single_special/artikel/leistung-von-it-systemen-vorhersagen/},\n  comment = {Samuel Kounev and J\\\"{u}rgen Walter},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/916.pdf},\n}\n\n','\n\neinBLICK (Robert&nbsp;Emmerich).\nLeistung von IT-Systemen vorhersagen.\npages 1-2, December 2015.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-PMX2015\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://www.presse.uni-wuerzburg.de/einblick/single_special/artikel/leistung-von-it-systemen-vorhersagen/\" target=\"blank\">http</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/916.pdf\" target=\"blank\">.pdf</a>&nbsp;
